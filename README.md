## INTRODUCTION

RL agents are trained on a custom made racing game. The goal is train multiple algorithms to race on the same tracks and see which one is the best across all F1 tracks.


## RACING CAR-ALGORITHMS

</p>

- `Blue Cars`: Correspond to Policy-Based Algorithms (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO). These agents learn a policy directly by optimizing the expected return, focusing on selecting the best action in each state.

- `Green Cars`: Represent Value-Based Algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Learning, DQN). These agents learn to estimate the value of actions and states, aiming to improve decision-making based on long-term expected rewards.

- `Both Colors (Blue + Green)`: These cars utilize Hybrid Algorithms that combine both policy-based and value-based approaches, such as Actor-Critic methods, where one part learns the policy and another learns the value function.

- `White Cars`: Indicate the use of a Genetic Algorithm. These cars evolve over time through selection, mutation, and crossover, mimicking natural evolution to optimize their behavior.

## Next Steps

- [x] Train PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- [x] Train A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
- [x] Test all cars on the test track
- [x] Create a reinforcement learning course explaining the project and algorithms
- [ ] Add more tracks for evaluation
- [ ] Create a competition using all available tracks
- [ ] Add a track/circuit creator tool
